# Scenario: Semantic Game Research with Chatweave

## Overview  
A user is investigating the evolution of Quake modding communities from 1999 to 2005. Instead of juggling tabs, search engines, and fragmented notes, they use **Chatweave**, a Chrome extension that seamlessly integrates local LLM cognition with browser context.

## Interaction Flow

### 1. User Intent  
User inputs a high-level query via the Chatweave panel:  
> "Trace Quake modding culture between 1999â€“2005. Prefer archival posts, developer notes, and community retrospectives."

### 2. Context Recognition  
Chatweave retrieves prior session threads related to:
- Game history and preservation  
- Tooling lineage and community ecosystems  
- Preference for authenticity over commercial fluff  

### 3. Semantic Search Activation  
Chatweave searches the web, weighting results based on:
- Time relevance (1999â€“2005)  
- Source credibility (forums, archived blogs, developer notes)  
- Narrative depth (stories over announcements)

### 4. In-Browser Augmentation  
Results appear as tagged cards beside the browser tab:
- ðŸ§µ Threaded community discussions  
- ðŸ›  Mod tool evolution  
- ðŸ§± Cultural impact and legacy

Chatweave offers inline summaries, semantic bookmarks, and option to cluster links by theme.

### 5. Sponsored Content (Opt-In)  
Contextual recommendations, such as:
- Indie modding books  
- Toolkits aligned with the time period  
- Asset libraries â€” filtered by intent, never intrusive

### 6. Session Anchoring  
User saves the interaction:
- Links and annotations grouped by concept  
- Exportable for blogging, writing, or historical mapping  
- Stored with semantic markers for easy retrieval

## Design Notes  
- Extension is built for Chrome, using Manifest v3  
- No browser replacement â€” Chatweave layers cognition atop existing workflows  
- Chat respects ambiguity, encourages refinement, and never leads without consent

## Potential Extensions  
- Session replay and trace visualization  
- Plugin support for other research domains (e.g., compiler evolution, music mapping)  
- Lightweight graph view of topic evolution over time
